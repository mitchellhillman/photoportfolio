    <p>Hi!</p>

    <p>
      I am a software engineer and amateur photographer living in
      Charlottesville, Virginia. When a hand injury kept me from practicing
      painting and drawing I bought a camera and discovered the absolute joy of
      photography. Given my background in oil painting and abiding interest in
      art history I am particularly inspired by the composition of the great
      masters. But, I'm also keenly interested in capturing honest images which
      witness not only to Beauty but also Truth. This means I do not edit my
      photos heavily and prefer portraits with natural expressions.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks for your interest.</p>
    <p>&mdash; Mitch</p>
